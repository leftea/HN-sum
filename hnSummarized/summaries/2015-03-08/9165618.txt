One, two, three
I was a professor at four universities. [...] I sympathize I was an adjunct, and I could only tolerate the stress and exhaustionfor two years. [...] In fact, engaging students was a challenge I loved. [...] For one thing, there was the pay. [...] In fall of 2012, I earned $13,600 before tax. The following spring, I made $14,100. [...] In spring of 2013, I started my Thursdays at 8 a.m. in College Park, Md., taught at 4 p.m. at American University in Washington, D.C., and ended the day in D.C. with a Trinity Washington University class that wrapped up at 9 p.m. [...] At some point, I realized there was no ladder out of adjunct purgatory, no full-time positions within my reach. Nobody, especially none of my supervisors, wanted to admit this. [...] Replies to those posts appear here, as well as posts by staff writers.
