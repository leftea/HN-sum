[...] March 5, 2015 Conservancy Announces Funding for GPL Compliance Lawsuit VMware sued in Hamburg, Germany court for failure to comply with the GPL on Linux Software Freedom Conservancy announces today Christoph Hellwig's lawsuit against VMware in the district court of Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany. Hellwig, a key Linux kernel developer and one of the earliest members of Conservancy's GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers, has publicly denounced VMware's misuse of GPL-licensed code since 2007. [...] Meanwhile, Hellwig joined Conservancy's GPL Compliance for Linux Developers in late 2012. [...] After studying these materials over a long period, it became apparent that VMware's current ESXi products infringed many of Hellwig's own copyrights, due to VMware's failure to comply with Linux's license, GPLv2. During Hellwig's investigations, Conservancy continued to negotiate with VMware. Sadly, VMware's legal counsel finally informed Conservancy in 2014 that VMware had no intention of ceasing their distribution of proprietary-licensed works derived from Hellwig's and other kernel developers' copyrights, despite the terms of GPLv2. Conservancy therefore had no recourse but to support Hellwig's court action. [...] Both Hellwig and Conservancy do not at this time wish to comment further on the detailed facts of this lawsuit, as they relate to ongoing litigation. However, Conservancy will maintain a Frequently Asked Questions page regarding Hellwig's lawsuit against VMware and will update that FAQ list when our legal counsel deems such advisable. [...] Conservancy and Christoph urge those who support this this action and who support GPL compliance in general to donate generously to Conservancy's GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers.
