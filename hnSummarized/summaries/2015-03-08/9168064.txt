[...] After that, I started to pay attention to other apps my friends and I were playing. I saw that a lot of them featuredboy characters, and if girl characters did exist, you were actually required to pay for them. [...] Of the apps that did have gender-identifiable characters, 98 percent offered boy characters. [...] Even worse, of these 50 apps, 90 percent offered boy characters for free, while only 15 percent offered girl characters for free. [...] In one game, Survival Run with Bear Grylls, you canput the character in a Santa Claus suit for $1.98, but there is no girl to be had at any price. [...] I found that when anapp did sell girl characters, itcharged onaverage $7.53, which is a lot in the world of apps. After all, each of the apps I downloaded only cost an average of $0.26. In other words, girl characters cost about 29times more than the cost of the apps themselves. [...] I do not want to pay to be a girl. [...] If I werean app maker, the ethical issue of charging for girl characters and not boy characterswould be enough reason to change.
