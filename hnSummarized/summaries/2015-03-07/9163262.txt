Apples patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold. [...] Its because Apples gold is a metal matrix composite, not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apples gold harder and more scratch-resistantwhich Tim Cook touted during the September announcementand it also makes it less dense overall. The karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that other material is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if its a high-density metal. Table 1 of Apples patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings. [...] For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, its a savings of 53%. [...] In any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process.
