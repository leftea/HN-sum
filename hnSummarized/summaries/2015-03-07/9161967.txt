One, two, three
[...] Particularly because forms make light visible, and light is a sublime substance. [...] And, just like every day since, the Sun was shining and light was reflecting off their heads, back into space. Over the next 3,000 years that light zipped off into the galaxy, never to be seen again. But suppose a tiny portion of that light was headed right for a black hole. [...] But instead, got bent exactly 180 degrees, boomeranged around the black hole and headed straight back to Earth. [...] But we dont want that, we want the light to be completely reflected. To be reflected, so that we could see ancient Earth in the black hole, wed need a deflection of 180 degrees, or pi radians. [...] If you take a look at Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our own galaxy, youll see what I mean. [...] The best candidate so far is a black hole named MACHO-96-BLG-5, which was observed at a distance of about 3,000 light years from Earth. [...] The short answer is no, not with current telescopes.
