[...] Chapter 1: The g-h Filter Intuitive introduction to the g-h filter, which is a family of filters that includes the Kalman filter. [...] Chapter 5: One Dimensional Kalman Filters Implements a Kalman filter by modifying the Discrete Bayesian Filter to use Gaussians. This is a full featured Kalman filter, albeit only useful for 1D problems. Chapter 6: Multivariate Kalman Filter We extend the Kalman filter developed in the previous chapter to the full, generalized filter. [...] Chapter 8: Designing Kalman Filters Building on material in Chapter 6, walks you through the design of several Kalman filters. [...] Chapter 9: Nonlinear Filtering Kalman filter as covered only work for linear problems. [...] Chapter 11: Extended Kalman Filters Kalman filter as covered only work for linear problems. [...] Chapter 12: Designing Nonlinear Kalman Filters Works through some examples of the design of Kalman filters for nonlinear problems. [...] Chapter 13: Smoothing Kalman filters are recursive, and thus very suitable for real time filtering. [...] Chapter 16: Ensemble Kalman Filters Discusses the ensemble Kalman Filter, which uses a Monte Carlo approach to deal with very large Kalman filter states in nonlinear systems.
