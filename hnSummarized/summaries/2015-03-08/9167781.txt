One, two, three
If you can contribute such computing power, please contact me at john.tromp@gmail.com, and we'll get the computation going. The following list shows contributing servers and their progress. L10 is represented in ternary in the 10x10 position above, with empty representing 0, and black and white stones representing 1 and 2 respectively. The trits are in row-major order, with the most significant trit in the top-left. Of the 17 values below, only L2, L3, L7 and L10 can be represented as legal positions themselves. [...] This gzipped tar contains various programs used to compute the exact numbers. Many thanks to Gunnar Farnebck and Michal Kouck for their contributions. Gunnar wrote a legal counting program in pike, while Michal suggested the use of Chinese Remaindering and implemented a file based program. This small program approximates the probability of a random n*n position being legal. Additions and corrections are welcome.
