One, two, three
It's the first unityped language I've used since Objective-C in the early 90s that I really like. Yes, I still love Scala, but I think Clojure is pretty much the best designed computer language I've ever used... and maybe that's because Clojure is mostly "less is more" but in a few places, it's not. [...] It's performant, predictable, and has a very nice ecosystem of libraries. [...] But that's not always what I want. [...] Pixie has all the good attributes of Clojure, but has a 10MB runtime. [...] So, Pixie is "Clojure without the weight of the JVM". [...] I need to do some yak shaving. [...] However, I immediately ran into Greenspun's Tenth. [...] I was also looking for a reason to using Pixie in anger, so I started to look into embedding Pixie in my Go code. [...] I urge you to check out Pixie.
