[...] If you want to conduct your own similar experiment, the source code is here. info Nothing has been done to prevent the site from being indexed, however the NOARCHIVE meta tag is specified which instructs Google not to cache their own copy of the content. This partition is then destroyed immediately after launching the site. [...] The content is flushed from memory once the site detects that it has been indexed. The URL of the site can be algorithmically generated and is configured via environment variable, so this source code can be made public without disclosing the location of the site to bots. Visitors can leave comments on the site while it is active.
