[...] Today, many things have changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the TextSecure transport, which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain committed to supporting plaintext SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an encrypted transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol. [...] Unlike the TextSecure transport, the encrypted SMS/MMS flow is high friction from the start. [...] In addition to that friction, the edge cases for encrypted SMS/MMS are where users feel real pain. [...] However, iOS does not have APIs that allow us to programatically send/receive SMS messages. This means that encrypted SMS messages to iPhone users wont work, which creates potentially confusing compatibility issues for users. [...] We dont want the state-run telcos in Saudi, Iran, Bahrain, Belarus, China, Egypt, Cuba, USA, etc to have direct access to the metadata of TextSecure users in those countries or anywhere else. [...] So youre not monsters, but SMS/MMS is more reliable than data. [...] Weve just started rolling out TextSecure version 2.6.0, which will be the last major release version to support encrypted SMS/MMS. TextSecure 2.7.0 will only support encryption through the TextSecure transport, as well as plaintext SMS/MMS.
